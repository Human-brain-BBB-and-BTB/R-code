Dysfunction in human cerebrovasculature contribute to pathogenesis of multiple neurological diseases, and the blood brain barrier (BBB), an organotypic specialization of the cerebrovasculature, impedes the delivery of systemic therapies for nearly all brain disorders.Here we developed a novel methodology to isolate fresh cells from the human cerebrovasculature with high capture efficiency and cell viability, and performed single-cell mRNA sequencing (scRNAseq) for human cerebrovascular cells from 13 surgical resected samples, including normal human brain tissue and gliomas, the most common brain malignancy. We profiled the transcriptome of 103,230 single cells, including 57,324 endothelial cells and 27,703 mural cells.We molecular defined the principle vascular cell types in the BBB, and uncovered molecular underpinning of heterogeneity in endothelial cells, mural cells and perivascular fibroblasts along the arteriovenous axis.

All data analysis were performed under R (version 3.6.3). packages used for analysis can be found below:
Seurat (Version 3.1.1), Monocle (version 2.14.0), ClusterProfiler (version 3.14.3), CellChat (version 1.6.0), infercnv (version 1.2.1)
